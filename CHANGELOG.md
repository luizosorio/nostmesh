### Added

- `nostmesh version` and `nostmesh config validate` commands.
- Declarative configuration with deny-by-default policy and validation that
  reports every problem at once.
- Architecture tests enforcing that the core imports no operating system
  package, no adapter, and never shells out for network effects.
- Portability guard: CI cross-compiles for Linux, Windows and macOS.
- License policy enforcement and secret scanning in CI.
- ADRs NM-01 through NM-05 recording language and stack, repository layout,
  license policy, control/data plane separation, and the single-binary
  netlink decision.
